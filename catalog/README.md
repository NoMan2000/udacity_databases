# SQL/Flask App

First, you need to have the correct python version, see `.python-version` and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
 
This will download the files used.

To run the app, type 

    export FLASK_APP=routes.py
    flask run

Then visit `localhost:5000` and you should be up and running.
